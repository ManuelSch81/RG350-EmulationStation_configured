---------------------------------------

This theme was inspired by Florian Hurtaut's theme which was released for EmulationStation 1.x.
I have built the theme using EmulationStation for Windows and have tested with a Raspberry Pi 2 B with a 320 MB memory split at 1920x1080 resolution. I have yet to test this theme with older Raspberry Pi models. I have a Raspberry Pi B+ that I will test with in the future.

Remove Scroll Sound

If you do not want or like the scroll sound for the game lists I have provided a blank wave file that can replace the click sound. To do this open the nbba theme folder then the main folder. Inside of the folder delete the 'sound.wav' file and rename the 'nosound.wav' file to 'sound.wav'

Hope you enjoy
